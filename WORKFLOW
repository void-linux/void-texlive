GENERAL APPROACH:
- each tlmgr package becomes texlive-$pkgname
- .ARCH prefixes are renamed to -bin (so dependencies don't mention .ARCH)
  .infra is renamed to -infra
- we build texlive from source tarball
  - and package all binaries as subpkgs texlive-$subpkg-bin
  - all symlink-only .ARCH packages reside in texlive, which provides= them
- other binaries are repacked, as well as all non-binary packages

UPDATING:
- run update.sh to fetch from a CTAN mirror
- if needed:
	- adjust subpkgs for all binary packages we build yourself
	- run gen-subpkgs.sh > ~/xbps-packages/srcpkgs/texlive/subpkgs
	- run gen-provides.sh > ~/xbps-packages/srcpkgs/texlive/provides
	- run generated mklinks.sh in ~/xbps-packages/srcpkgs
	- build texlive package
- optional:
	- run findmissing.sh to see which pkgs will be built
- run buildmissing.sh to build them
